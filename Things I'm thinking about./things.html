<ul>
    <li>I need to start working with finacial data, because that seems to be all people care about. Where can I continually gather tons of live finacial data, and where can I store it for free?</li>
    <li>chi-squared tests and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, among others: I've been told to use them but I don't because I need to review statistics first.</li>
    <li>I don't know what Gibbs Sampling is and I don't know what Metropolis sampling is, so there's no way I know what Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling</li>
    <li> Memorizing the formulations of Accuracy, Precision,  Recall, Specificity, and the F1 Score because I use confusion matrices all the time and gain inuitive insight from them but no longer remember the official vocabulary for those insights and will surely be asked about them during an interview</li>
