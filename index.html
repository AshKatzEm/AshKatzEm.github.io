      <h1>Asher Katz</h1>
      <p class="introduction">
        Hi there, I'm an extremely curious perpetual student who's fascinated by the use of mathematics, science, computers and, above all, creative experimentation to understand the world around me and overcome it's challenges. Borne out of this fascination, I've spent years using data to better my understanding of the phenomena all around me. <a href="Projects/projects.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow" class="projects">Here are some questions that I have explored using data</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        This fascination began when my professors challenged me to understand the world in a more concrete way. If I wanted to have an opinion about Climate Change, I'd need to develop a deep understanding of Climate Science. If I wanted to have an opinion about gender identity, I'd need to develop a deep understanding of Reproductive Biology (at least that's what they told me). If I wanted to have an opinion about Net Neutrality, I'd need to develop a deep understanding of Telecommunication Engineering. While I always liked "science", I never felt like I personally needed to understand it, as long as someone understood it. I hated Math and was always trying to get out of it in High School. Yet here I was starting to research Telecommunication Engineering, and I was finding math and Physics everywhere. Now however, it was all deeply compelling and that was because I didn't really know what Math, let alone Science, really was. As I began to understand, math was "a language" used to quantifiably describe the world in the most abstract way, yet also the most concrete way. To understand what math is, why it's necessary, and how to use it, I had to see it being used. It's not just challenges used to test student computational aptitude and memory, as I believed in high school. There was a whole world of profound truth and meaning all around me which I didn't even know existed. Everything in life was arbitrary, it just happened because it has always happened that way, I started understanding basic math the I even recognized that I held this belief. Suddenly, most everything in life happened for a reason and I could understand when it would happen again. It was a deeply religious moment for me which completely changed the way I think and behave.

 I should narrow the text, empty space on both sides, on the pipeline page, if not all pages 
 Add hooks to each projects summary, pics below, results, app below , tree explorer etc..-->
