  Hi there, I'm an extremely curious perpetual student who's fascinated by the use of mathematics, science, computers and, above all, creative experimentation to understand the world around me and overcome it's challenges. Borne out of this  fascination, I've spent years using machine learning to better my understanding of the phenomena all around me. Here are some examples:
  <p><a href="Property_Values_project/Property.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow">What determines the prices of apartments in Queens, NY?</a></p>
  <p><a href="ESRB_project/ESRB.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow">What REALLY determines the ESRB content rating which a video game is given? </a></p>
  <p><a href="Classroom_Data_ Project/Classroom.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow">If I developed an interactive math class and collected student data, could I continually use the insight to guide furthur sessions?</a></p>
  <p><a href="SQL_project/pipeline.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow">ESRB ratings are elusive. If I build a PostgreSQL data pipeline to harvest a higher quality, 60x larger dataset, can I determine what ESRB content rating a video game will be given?  </a></p>
  <p><a href="Weather_Explorer/weather.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow">Can I build a data pipeline which perpetually pipes live weather data into a database and then deploy a web app which allows anyone with a browser to explore the perpetually growing weather data?</a></p>

<!-- I should add a resume to the home page
 I should narrow the text, empty space on both sides, on the pipeline page, if not all pages 
 Add hooks to each projects summary, pics below, results, app below , tree explorer etc..-->
